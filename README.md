A small hashing directory diff tool written in python

It uses python-docopt for option parsing, so have that handy.

Use Case
========

1. Digging for matching binary blobs in two different directory trees.
2. Checking if there are any files in ~/backup/oldhome/netbook-home/backup/docs that are/are not in ~/docs.

But...
======

1. There's already 'xyz' to do that!
   - Nice, I didn't know. I only did a cursory search.
   I needed a tool and it seemed quicker to write one than to search any longer.
   Turned out ok, so others might like it as well :)
